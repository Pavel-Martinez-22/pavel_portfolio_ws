          <h3>HTML &amp; CSS Showcase</h3>
          <p>This project reflects my ability to build semantically structured and responsive web pages through a series
            of themed exercises and creative implementations. It also helps demonstrate my evolving proficiency in HTML
            and CSS. As one of my earliest web development efforts, it serves as a benchmark for my growth in frontend
            design and semantic coding practices.In this project I implemented custom CSS styling, created tables,
            designed forms, and incorporated box model and layout techniques.</p>
          <!--            <div>
            <p>The showcase includes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Linked multi-page website: Demonstrates navigation structure and semantic HTML organization.</li>
              <li>Custom CSS styling: Applies classes and IDs to style elements with selectors, declarations, layout rules and animations.</li>
              <li>Table creation: Builds structured data tables using table elements to organize and present information semantically.</li>
              <li>Form design: Implements user input forms with various field types and labels, styled with CSS.</li>

            <h3>PHP OOP REST API </h3>
            <p>This project demonstrates my ability to build a PHP-based object-oriented REST API for managing
              quotations,
              supporting full CRUD operations via GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. The backend was developed using
              PHP
              and PostgreSQL, with environment variables for secure configuration, and deployed to Render after local
              testing with Postman and XAMPP. On the frontend, I used JavaScript, PHP, and CSS to fetch and display JSON
              data returned by the API. JavaScript handles asynchronous requests and dynamically injects the content
              into
              the appropriate HTML elements. To streamline deployment and ensure consistency across environments, I
              containerized the entire application using Docker and deployed it as a web service.</p>

          <h3>RESTful API using Node.js</h3>
          <p>This project showcases my ability to build a RESTful API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to manage U.S.
            state data. I structured the application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to ensure clean
            separation of concerns and maintainable code. The server handles full CRUD operations via GET, POST, PATCH,
            and DELETE requests, with routes defined in Express and validated through custom middleware.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used Mongoose to define and enforce a schema for MongoDB, enabling structured storage of state-specific
            fun facts. The API merges static JSON data with dynamic database content using a custom function, allowing
            enriched responses while preserving original metadata. I tested all endpoints locally using Postman to
            verify proper JSON responses and error handling.

          <h3>Inventory Management System Project</h3>
          <p>This project is in collaboration with a team of four developers across three time zones to build an
            inventory management system. We coordinated through scheduled meetings and used Git for version control and
            seamless code integration. Our system featured a custom RESTful API built with Node.js and Express,
            supporting full CRUD operations via GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests. We integrated a PostgreSQL
            database and implemented role-based access control to ensure secure data handling. The frontend included a
            login screen with dynamic session management, allowing us to assign specific privileges to different user
            roles. To enhance usability, we built an alert system that monitored inventory levels and triggered
            automated email notifications when stock thresholds were reached — giving users real-time feedback and
            actionable insights.</p>
